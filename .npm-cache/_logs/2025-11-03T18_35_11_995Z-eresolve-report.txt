# npm resolution error report

While resolving: newsgenie@1.0.0
Found: @react-navigation/native@7.0.19
node_modules/@react-navigation/native
  @react-navigation/native@"~7.0.14" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @react-navigation/native@"^6.0.0" from @react-navigation/stack@6.3.29
node_modules/@react-navigation/stack
  @react-navigation/stack@"~6.3.20" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
